Chat with mst:

22:38 -!- Irssi: Starting query in Perl with mst
22:38 <torbjorn> i've been trying to understand how Config::Loader works and how the code is organized
22:38 <mst> sec
22:39 <mst> I think you want the 'matt' branch
22:39 <mst> yeah, kaitlyn dumped some pair programming on the train back from LPW into that branch and then I hit it with a stick
22:39 <mst> it should make a bit more sense
22:40 <torbjorn> oh i was wondering what that train thing was in one of the comit messages.
22:40 <torbjorn> turns out it was a train then
22:41  * mst laughs
22:41 <torbjorn> what remains to do? i couldnt tell if there are small bits missing, but all of it seems to work as designed
22:42 <mst> I think I was about ready to try and reimplement Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader and/or Config::ZOMG as a test / worked example
22:42 <torbjorn> ok
22:42 <torbjorn> that would be nice
22:42 <mst> well, take ZOMG apart and see
22:42 <mst> that's probably an easy one to try
22:43 <torbjorn> ill have a go at it
22:43 <mst> also that way, free test suite
22:43 <mst> and having you try will help check over the architecture
22:43 <torbjorn> division of labour is always nice
22:43 <torbjorn> ok
22:43 <mst> I have to go shortly but I'll be back tomorrow
22:44 <torbjorn> np, i shuold be able to get a good crack at it
22:44 <torbjorn> thanks
22:44 <mst> sorry for ignoring you earlier, if /whois says I'm active you'r always welcome to go 'mst: OI! BLIND BASTARD!'
22:44 <torbjorn> ok :) noted
22:45 <torbjorn> ill OI you when things need a good spanking with a stick
22:46 <torbjorn> its only hosted on github, not a cat server?
22:46 <mst> kaitlyn's originally so in her github
22:46 <mst> we can shift it elsewhere if we need to
22:46 <mst> probably p5sagit@ temporarily and then back to a github org once it's working
22:47 <mst> it's git. it's not like it's hard to move stuff around :)
22:47 <mst> if you get stuck, talk on #web-simple - frew wrote ZOMG and will probably help once he works out wtf I talked you into trying
22:48 <torbjorn> heh ok , making a note of that too
22:49 <mst> also #web-simple seems to've become #mst-random-projects anyway
22:49 <torbjorn> i see. ill get there. so for now ill just make a new git branch from "matt" and stuff things in there?
22:49 <mst> right
22:50 <mst> it's early days yet, we can make the repo sensible later
22:50 <torbjorn> yes
22:50 <torbjorn> ok, ill see you again when its all nice and shiny
22:50 <mst> do bear in mind that if the current code gets in the way, there's nothing wrong with tweaking or refactoring
22:50 <mst> I just figured the best way to find out what was actually needed at this point was to try doing shit
22:51 <mst> also, if you produce a hack that passes ZOMG's tests, we can always de-hack it afterwards
22:51 <torbjorn> ok. the structure/architecture of C::L seems pretty good, from what i gather from the git log (i looked at all diff's for all commits!) there seems to have been a sensible refactoring along the way too
22:54 <mst> yeah, well, https://metacpan.org/author/SYMKAT # she's no slouch even without me collaborating
